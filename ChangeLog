CHANGES SINCE 2.3

1. Fix: The prompt script now reports any errors when it runs.  The prompt script uses the default prompt on an error instead of being a blank string.

2. New: new example scripts: git_prompt_script. [Needs updating]

3. Fix: missing files with 2> and 2>> now reported as an error.  (<, > and >> were working properly).

4. Change: Bourne shell redirection operators now behave closer to Bourne shell standard in terms of whitespace around the operators. [Tests needed]

5. New: Bourne shell dollar brace ${...} variable substitutions. [Docs needed, tests needed]
