Objective: Shell and Command Line Improvements

CHANGES SINCE 2.3.1

1. [Pascal B/ jrmarino] Fix: OS/x and FreeBSD patch.  

CHANGES SINCE 2.3

2. Fix: The prompt script now reports any errors when it runs.  The prompt script uses the default prompt on an error instead of being a blank string.

3. New: new example scripts: git_prompt_script,

4. Fix: missing files with 2> and 2>> now reported as an error.  (<, > and >> were working properly).

5. Fix: file paths for redirection may not immediately follow a redirection (no longer require a space).

5. New: Bourne shell dollar brace ${...} variable substitutions.

6. New: Bourne shell dollar parenthesis $(...) command substitution.

7. New: Bourne shell length expansion ${#VAR}.

8. New: Bourne shell ~user is equivalent to /home/user.

9. Refactor: Bourne shell parsing completely rewritten to provide the foundation for certain new features.

10. Fix: (shell rewrite) high-ascii characters in SQL commands. [testing needed]

11. Fix: (shell rewrite) "Word" can be used as a variable name.

12. Fix: (shell rewrite) 2>&1 fixed to redirect in a pipeline.

13. Fix: (shell rewrite) 2>&1 no longer redirects output for all commands in the pipeline, to match Bourne shell behaviour.

14. New: (shell rewrite) ${:-}, ${:+} and ${:?}.

15. New: (shell rewrite) Glob patterns are allowed in directories in a path (e.g. ls /home/k*/*.txt is now possible).

16. Change: cd, env and unset no longer show the variable name in maintenance mode.  Because these are shell commands, an accidental use of a variable expansion could reveal values in production.

14. New: (shell rewrite) $* and $@.

15. New: pragma annotate( accounts ...).

16. New (shell rewrite) AdaScript `` may have backslash escapes.

17. New: variable declaration names are checked for common mispellings (e.g. "hi" vs. "high") should the similar variable exist and be visible. [types, etc. too]

18. New: long names ought to have underscores. [type tests needed]

19. Fix: trailing underscores not allowed in variable names.

20. Fix: fixed constraint error on certain text_io subprocedures.

21. Fix: shell statements in a case statement now parsed properly.

22. New: pragma declare_constraint and pragma constraint for design constraints.

23. Fix: pragma restriction, suppress, software_model, license now checked for an identifier name (rather than a string, number or some other token).

24. Fix: pragma license and software_model show the names in the error message for unknown value.

25. Fix: updated man page to version 2.4.  Updated version to 2.4.

26. Fix: static expressions, such as used in pragmas, are now being evaluated.

27. New: pragma declare_affinity and pragma affinity for design affinities.

28. New: pragma suppress( no_empty_command_substitutions ).

29. Fix: s := `` no longer gives a trailing whitespace error message.

30. Change: new support for GNU readline library (third-party areadline library removed).

31. Change: new command line completion capabilities (assignment completion, executable command completion, subcommand completion for certain Linux commands).

32. Fix: Updated Git prompt script example for GNU readline.

33. Fix: Files.Is_Directory no longer appends an unnecessary ASCII.NUL to the path.

34. New: shell history saved as ~/.sparforte_history.
