	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p>This section contains answers to frequently asked questions on Sparforte.</p>

<p>See also: Git-Hub Wiki at
<a href="https://github.com/kburtch/SparForte/wiki">https://github.com/kburtch/SparForte/wiki</a>.</p>

<h3>General Questions</h3>

<h4>What does Sparforte Stand For?</h4>

<img class="padded_left" src="pictures/sf2_ryu.png" width="128" height="103" alt="[Ryu]" />

<p>To "spar" is to duel.  "Forte" (pronounced FORE-tay) is a music term
for loudness.  If you are going to spar, spar loud.  Together "Sparforte"
expresses "sound design".</p>

<img class="padded_right" src="pictures/roosevelt_bridge.jpg" width="128" height="92" alt="[Roosevelt Bridge]" />
<p>"Spar" is also a stout naval mast or boom and "Forte" is a proficiency
or skill.  So, alternatively, "Sparforte" can also mean a proficient or
skillful programming framework.</p>

<p>Spar can also mean to argue in a non-aggressive way, as with critics.</p>

<p>"Sparforte" expresses confident strength and quality engineering.  Work
fast.  Work well.</p>

<h4>What is the Difference between Bush (Business Shell) and Sparforte?</h4>

<p>The Business Shell (or Bush) was the original name of the project.</p>

<p>There were frequent complaints that Bush was a poor choice for Internet
searches.  "Bush" results in millions of page hits for a famous family.
"Business Shell" resulted in millions of pages hits for a petroleum
company.</p>

<p>After several dozen names were reviewed, "Sparforte" was chosen as the
new name for the project.</p>

<h4>Can Sparforte run Bush (Business Shell) scripts?</h4>

<p>Yes.  The only exception is that web template tags must be
<code>&lt;?spar</code> instead of <code>&lt;?bush</code>.</p>

<h4>What is AdaScript?  How does it relate to Sparforte?</h4>

<p>AdaScript is the programming language used by Sparforte.  Sparforte
is the original AdaScript interpreter.  Since the language and the
interpreter names are different, other projects can be developed using
AdaScript&mdash;even other interpreters.</p>

<h4>Do I need to know Ada to learn AdaScript?</h4>

<p>No.  In fact, AdaScript may be easier to learn than Ada.  Also, the
documentation doesn't assume knowledge of another language.</p>

<h4>What are the biggest differences between Ada and AdaScript?</h4>

<p>AdaScript is intended to be a subset of Ada 95 with extensions
for the Bourne shell and SQL.  However, if you come from an Ada
background, you'll notice some key differences:</p>

<ol>
<li>AdaScript is case sensitive</li>
<li>Numeric and character literals are universal types.</li>
<li>String literals are unbounded_strings not fixed strings / arrays.</li>
<li>Ada attributes are implemented as built-in package functions.</li>
<li><code>with</code> and <code>use</code> are not available.  Built-in functions have similar
package names but may not be identical.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Is Sparforte a "cloud" language or an "agile" language?  Is there a
single thing it excels at?  What is it's "killer app"?</h4>

<p>Sparforte is designed to improve speed and quality in development over
rival tools while managing the SDLC, scaling and code aging better.  These, of
course, are not things that will excite your coworkers or management.
These are general things that impact many aspects of development.  I'm not
a marketer and I don't have trendy buzzwords word attach to Sparforte.</p>

<h3>Using Sparforte</h3>

<h4>How Do I Use Vim with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>The Sparforte download page has a file called "spar.vim".  If you have
access to the vim syntax folder (usually /usr/share/vim/.../syntax),
you can copy this file to that folder.

<p>If you can't install the spar.vim file, you use it as a local, custom
syntax file as described at <a href="http://www.fleiner.com/vim/create.html">http://www.fleiner.com/vim/create.html</a>.</p>

<p>To make vim use the syntax highlighting, you can add this to your .vimrc
configuration file.</p>

<pre>
syntax on
filetype on
</pre>

<p>Or enable modeline support with "set modeline"  in your .vimrc</p>

<pre>
syntax on
filetype on
set modeline
</pre>

<p>and include the file type in vim instructions embedded in a comment in your
program like this:</p>

<pre>
-- vim: ft=spar
</pre>

<b>Screenshot</b>: camel.sp script in Vim 7.3 using Sparforte mode</p>

<h4>How Do I Use KDevelop with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Switch the editor language to Ada.  This will provide around 90% of the
highlighting and other features you are looking for.  This is located
under Editor / Tools / Highlighting / Source menu.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/spar_on_kdevelop.png" width="724" height="500" alt="[Screenshot of Sparforte script on KDevelop]"><br>
<b>Screenshot</b>: camel.sp script in KDevelop 4.2 using Ada mode</p>

<h4>How Do I Use Eclipse with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Eclipse has support for Ada (though I've never tried it).  There is
a AdaCore's GNATBench plug-in for GCC Ada, AonixADT for the Aonix Ada
compiler, and an Ada Developer Tools project.  There may be others.  See
if you can configure one of these plug-ins to recognize Sparforte scripts
as Ada.  This may give you 90% of the highlighting and other features you are
looking for.</p>

<h4>How Do I Use Microsoft VS Code with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Ada support will give you most of the features you are looking for.
Install the Ada support plug-in.  Then change the user settings in
the File / Preferences / Settings screen and map the Sparforte file
extension to the Ada language:</p>

<pre>
{
"files.associations": { "*.sp": "ada"}
}
</pre>

<h4>How Do I Use NetBeans with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>NetBeans has support for Ada (though I've never tried it).  There is
an Ada Plug-in.  See if you can configure the plug-in to recognize
Sparforte scripts as Ada.  This may give you 90% of the highlighting and
other features you are looking for.</p>

<h4>When I use spar as a login shell, why can't I use Control-D to log out?</h4>

<p>This is the same behaviour as in the Bash shell if you use the
ignoreeof option.  It is to prevent you from accidentally logging
yourself out when exiting several shells quickly using Control-D.</p>

<h4>How Do I Install Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions in the INSTALL text file included with
your download.</p>

<h4>Can I build Sparforte without any database engine?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h4>Can I build Sparforte without SDL/OpenGL support?</h4>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h4>Are there any Linux distributions that carry Sparforte?</h4>

<p>At the last time I checked, volunteers have added Sparforte to
ArchLinux and Fedora Linux.</p>

<h4>How Do I Report a Sparforte Bug?</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions in the Intro/Preface section of this
documentation.</p>

<h3>Programming Questions</h3>

<h4>Why do I get an error when I run a command with a long option on the command prompt?</h4>

<p>In a command like "ls --help", Sparforte appends a semi-colon before
running the command.  But "--" is the comment symbol and the semi-colon
is hidden as part of the comment, producing a "shell word or semi-colon
expected" or "End of File" error.  The solution is to escape the
double-minus.  For example, use quotes around the long option, or
backslashes before each minus sign, or use AdaScript parameters.</p>

<h4>Why can't I use put_line, ?, etc. to start a command pipeline?</h4>

<p>There are 3 kinds of subprograms in Sparforte: commands, procedures
and functions.  Commands can have the I/O redirected.  Functions can
be used in expressions.  Procedures are stand-alone.  put_line and
related features are procedures so they can't be used in a command pipeline.</p>

<h4>I declared a variable inside of a pragma debug but it wasn't declared.
Why not?</h4>

<p>The commands in the backquotes aren't evaluated until the script runs.
When the script syntax is checked, the variable declaration hasn't
executed yet so the variable doesn't exist.</p>

<h4>I used "with separate" inside of a pragma debug but it nothing seemed
to happen.  Why not?</h4>

<p>The commands in the backquotes are a small script.  When the commands
run, the "with separate" subscript is loaded into the running script, the
small script in the backquotes, instead of the main script.</p>

<h4>How do I convert strings to numbers?</h4>

<p>There are built-in functions to do this.
<p><code>numerics.value</code> converts a string to its equivalent value: <code>numerics.value("5")</code> returns 5.</p>
<p><code>numerics.pos</code> returns the Latin-1 value <code>numerics.pos( "A" )</code> returns 65.</p>

<h4>When I convert numbers to strings, why do they sometimes have a leading space character?</h4>

<p>For historical reasons, the Ada language uses a leading space for
positive numbers and a leading minus for negative numbers.  Sparforte
also follows this convention for GCC Ada compatibility.  So "?",
strings.image, put_line, etc. will put a leading space before a
positive number.</p>

<p>To remove the leading space, use <code>strings.trim()</code>.</p>

<h4>How do I read in a number like scanf, readln, etc?</h4>

<p><code>get_line</code> returns a universal type, not a string,
so it can save to a string or numeric variable.

<p><tt>n : integer := get_line</tt></p>

<p>You can also cast the result using <tt>numerics.value</tt> like this:</p>

<p><tt>n := numerics.value( get_line );</tt></p>

<h4>How do I format numbers like <tt>printf</tt>?</h4>

<p>The built-in <code>put</code> procedure (not <code>put_line</code>) can
do this.  The optional final parameter is a picture string
describing the number's layout.  See <code>put</code> in the "text_io" package
section.</p>

<h4>How do I create a C-style string?</h4>

<p>Create a string and append an ASCII or Latin_1 NUL character.</p>

<pre>
  c_string1 : string := "This is a C string" &amp; ASCII.NUL
  c_string2 : string := "This is a C string" &amp; Latin_1.NUL
</pre>

<h4>What does it mean when a type is <tt>limited</tt>?</h4>

<p>A limited type is a type that cannot be assigned in an assignment
statement.  It can still be used in parameters.  Typically a limited
type is used to protect against "shallow copying" of data structures.
Although Sparforte has no pointers and thus no shallow copying issues,
limited types are used for sharing tokens or id numbers which should
not be altered. An example is the <code>file_type</code> type.</p>

<h4>How do I use an environment variable like <tt>LOGNAME</tt>?</h4>

<p>You have to import it first:</p>

<p><tt>LOGNAME : string;</tt><br><tt>pragma import( shell, LOGNAME );</tt></p>

<p>If you want to make LOGNAME available to other programs as an
environment variable, you'll also have to <tt>export</tt> it.</p>

<h4>What's the difference between an <tt>in</tt>, <tt>out</tt> and
<tt>in out</tt> parameters?</h4>

<p>An <code>in</code> parameter is one that is used by a subprogram but
will not be altered.  An <code>out</code> parameter is one that is
created by the subprogram and any initial value is ignored.  An
<code>in out</code> parameter is one that is used by the subprogram but
may be altered by the time the subprogram is finished.</p>

<p>There is no equivalent of pass-by-value or pass-by-reference.</p>

<h4>How do I change my command prompt?</h4>

<p>Use <code>pragma prompt_script</code>.  More information is in the
reference section.</p>

<h4>How do I run a command with spaces in the name?</h4>

<p>Put double quotes around the command name.</p>

<h4>How do I write a shell command over multiple lines?</h4>

<p>The command prompt commands must be on a single line.</p>

<p>Sparforte scripts support shell commands over multiple lines.  You do not use
a backslash at the end of a line as in a Bourne Shell.  For example,
these commands are the same:</p>

<span><tt>ls -l;</tt></span><br>
<span><tt>ls</tt></span><br>
<span><tt>-l;</tt></span><br>

<h4>Why can I only import and export string variables?</h4>

<p>Variables in Sparforte may be of many different types and
the values are represented in ways specific to the language.
When Ken designed pragma import/export, strings were believed
to be the most fundamental way of transferring information
between Sparforte and other languages.  In addition,
environment variables are actually strings.</p>

<p>However, passing a numeric variable through import and
export between Sparforte scripts means converting the variable
to/from a string, which is inconvenient.  It is possible that
the importing/exporting other types of variables will be done in the
future.</p>

<P>As a security feature, Sparforte requires all imported variables
to be imported to a user-defined type.  You can add an
<code>affirm</code> clause to validate the incoming data.</p>

<h4>Can you do Continuous Integration with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>CI is a technique were tests are automatically run on a regular basis to
detect errors as quickly as possible.  This requires a set of test programs
that can perform tests without human intervention.  Most CI frameworks
will run a shell command or script to start the tests.  As long as you can
create a start script and a set of test programs, you can use CI with
Sparforte.</p>

<p>Sparforte includes a test mode that can run unit tests and report on
the success of the tests.  The tests can be embedded in the source
code.</p>

<p>You can get a rough idea of test coverage by running Sparforte with
the trace feature turned on.  This displays the lines the language reads,
not the lines it executes, but you can use the lines in the report
to estimate which lines ran a test.</p>

<h4>Can you do Test-driven Development with Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Sparforte runs in test phase mode of the SDLC.  It will
run automated tests by default unless you switch to another phase of the
SDLC.</p>

<h4>Is there a libspar I can call to run Spar scripts from another
language, like I can with Lua?</h4>

<p>AdaScript is an interpreted language: the "spar" interpreter must be used
to run a program.</p>

<p>A "libspar" is expected in the future.</p>

<h4>Is there something like "use" or "static with" so I can use "length" instead of "strings.length"?</h4>

<p>Not yet.  There will be more information on this in future versions.</p>

<h4>What is a "style issue"?</h4>

<p>A style issue is an error caused by something that is technically
allowed by the language but may cause debugging or maintenance problems.
These can rules of common sense based on the human nature.  For example,
lowercase L cannot be used as a variable name (it looks like a one),
nor can the name "NULL" (it looks like a reserved word).</p>

<h3>Design Questions</h3>

<h4>Is Sparforte a real shell?</h4>

<p>Yes.  Sparforte implements its command line features natively.  It is not
a preprocessor for another shell.</p>

<h4>Isn't Sparforte just another "my favourite language" shell?</h4>

<p>There are several open source shells such as Java's bean shell and
Perl's zoidberg.  These attempt to create shells with a structure
familiar to practitioners of those languages.</p>

<p>Sparforte chose compatibility with Ada because Ada was the only
top 20 language that had the capability to meet Sparforte's vision.
This is the same reason that NASA, aerospace, air traffic control,
robotics, and financial institutions chose Ada over Java, Perl, etc.</p>

<h4>"Code Complete 2" calls Ada a dinosaur that has been supplanted
by other languages.</h4>

<p>Ada is standard on most versions of Linux.  It remains one of the
the top 10/top 20 (depending on which survey you read) languages in
the world.  It is the most popular language for high-reliability
applications.  Ada has not been supplanted by Java or PHP because
those languages traditionally solve different problems and target
different audiences than Ada.</p>

<p>"Code Complete 2" also states that Ada is not expressive.  "Expressive"
could mean different things.  See my article on The Lone Coder site on the
myth of agile languages, "What is an Agile Language?".</p>

<h4>"Software Creativity 2.0" calls Ada a real-time programming
language, unsuitable for other applications, and it died because
it was used where it was not intended.</h4>

<p>While I have great respect for Mr. Glass, these statements are
incorrect and hype.  It is akin to saying that Java is a
language for doing cute web animations and was never intended for
developing business applications.  Ada was, and is, a general purpose
programming language for large projects.  It was never a real-time
specific language, though it is used for real-time systems and has
features to support them in the language Annexes.  There is nothing
in Ada to prevent its use in business, nor am I aware of any
business projects that lead to Ada being unpopular.  Ada has
remained one of the most popular languages since Mr. Glass' book
was written.  (More people use Ada than, say, Groovy or Scala.)
Ada remains popular in real-time applications because many
other languages ignore the requirements of these types of
projects.</p>

<h4>Many popular languages are "mash-ups" of other languages.  Isn't
Sparforte just another example?</h4>

<p>The Bourne shell features in AdaScript are a compatibility layer
provided for command line and scripting convenience.  It is a
strictly-defined alternative syntax in recognition of a standard
lasting decades.  It can also be turned off.</p>

<p>The command line SQL support is an attempt to address the problem
of "mode errors" (right command typed in the wrong interpreter or
"mode").   This also can be turned off.</p>

<h4>Is AdaScript an enterprise language?</h4>

<p>There is no strict definition of an enterprise language.  However, if you
consider "enterprise" to mean large applications with code reuse and features
such as strong typing to support quality programming, then you could consider
Sparforte an enterprise language.</p>

<h4>Is AdaScript a cloud language?</h4>

<p>There is no strict definition of an cloud language.  However, if you
consider "cloud" to mean to ability to create networked applications and to
access shared services like Memcached, then you could consider Sparforte to
be a cloud language.</p>

<h4>Can strong typing be used successfully in a shell?</h4>

<p>Sparforte makes allowances by supplying universal types (a form
of weak typing) and using "duck typing" when automatically declaring
variables at the command prompt.</p>

<h4>Why can't I undo <tt>pragma restriction</tt>, <tt>pragma ada_95</tt>, running in restricted shell mode, etc.?</h4>

<p>As a general rule, when restrictions are enforced they cannot be undone.
First, restrictions may be applied for security purposes.  Allowing them
to be undone would be a security risk.  Second, restrictions may be applied
for style or design reasons by architects or team leaders.  For example,
they might use <code>pragma ada_95</code> make source code as reusable as possible.  In
either case, the restrictions should not be undone.</p>

<h4>Where does the idea of "itself" come from?</h4>

<p>The itself operand was a part of "Pegasus Pascal", a Python-like
language Ken wrote for the Apple II in the mid-1990's before Ken
had heard of Python and before Python was popular.</p>

<h4>Why are there no objects?</h4>

<p>Objects, user-defined packages, etc. will be added as time allows.</p>

<h4>Why does AdaScript allow global variables?  Some experts say they
are bad.</h4>

<p>Currently, the only way to limit scope is a subprogram or a declare
statement.  A variable is global if it is declared at the top level of the
main script.  Expect more ways to control scope in the future.</p>

<p>More generally, opponents of global variables are concerned that these
variables can be unexpectedly modified by any piece of programming
and can lead to thread-unsafe programs.  Supporters of global variables
point out their convenience for short scripts, how large parameter lists
with repeated variables are difficult to read and maintain, and that
globals can be safely used by tacit agreement between programmers.</p>

<p>Sparforte implements safety features for working with global variables.
Since AdaScript is a shell and scripting language, global variables are
often useful.  They are also necessary for compatibility with Ada.</p>

<h4>Why does AdaScript lack <tt>goto</tt> statements?  Some experts say they are bad.</h4>

<p>AdaScript doesn't have a <code>goto</code> statements because of the
complexity of implementing <code>goto</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>goto</code> has had opponents back to the 1960's when programming languages were
less developed.  The belief was that an inexperienced programmer could misuse
the statement and create programs that were difficult to read and maintain.
Supporters of goto believe that the statement can improve readability and
maintenance in some cases: it is useful for breaking out of deeply nested loops,
handing certain types of errors (like retry conditions), implementing alternate
entry/exit points for initialization/cleanup (eliminating duplicate code),
that labels can improve readability by documenting intent. They also
believe that <code>goto</code> statements can improve performance as a result.</p>

<p>The <code>goto</code> statement may be implemented in the future.</p>

<h4>Does Sparforte catch Side-Effects?</h4>

<p>Sparforte uses three methods to detect side-effects and designs
that have side-effect risks.</p>

<h4>Is Sparforte innovative?</h4>

<p>For many years Ken has had many ideas for programming languages.  Some have
started appearing in popular languages.  Some have not.</p>

<p>AdaScript has always been a language based on standards and solving real-world
problems has always been its main objective.</p>

<p>While many of its features many not be innovative, it solves design problems
that other languages may find difficult.</p>

<h4>Won't big project features slow development of small nimble project?</h4>

<p>While reducing keystrokes is not a goal of Sparforte, it does have
several convenience features for the command prompt.  It also has the
concept of an "unstructured script", intended for small solutions,
which relax some of Sparforte's requirements.</p>

<p>However, with a typical real-world project, the number of keystrokes
has little to do with the speed of project development.  Projects are
dominated by reading, debugging, maintenance, etc. and these are managed
by Sparforte's design.</p>

<h4>Why target code reading, debugging and maintenance?  A programming
language cannot make a person think faster.</h4>

<p>While reading, debugging and designing/extending software are
think-intensive tasks, studies show that choice of language has
a measurable impact on these tasks.</p>

<h4>Aren't programming languages which do a lot of error checking just
reporting a lot of irrelevant bugs?</h4>

<p>The relevance of a bug is not measured by the type of bug but by the
impact on the application of the program in the real world.  A bug
may be costly in one situation or relatively harmless in another.  As a
result, any strategy for error checking will identify many bugs that are
not dangerous to a project.  The only way to remove the serious bugs
is try to do a thorough job of removing as many bugs as possible.</p>

<h4>Isn't your idea of Code Evolution is all about General Purpose languages?  I believe in Domain Specific languages which tailor solutions to specific environments.</h4>

<p>This is a false dichotomy.  A language doesn't have to be completely
general or completely incompatible with another language.  Part of
Sparforte's design uses domain-specific features, aspects of the
language that target specific environments such as the command prompt.
These features may be disallowed outside of their intended
environment.</p>

<p>Not everything evolves to produce superior features endure.
Is a shell's if statement really tailor-made to solve
shell scripting problems?  It's a throwback to when memory was critical
and shells did not have the ability to process an if expression.
If shells standardized the if statement, it wouldn't mean that the
shell was less effective at doing "shell stuff".</p>

<h4>Doesn't a web framework like Rails make a bigger difference than
Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Web frameworks only work while you use them the way the designers
intended.  If you try to add advanced features, you end up working
against the framework, and that increases your work.  Some frameworks
use complicated configuration files so you use configuration files as
if they were programs.  Rails, in particular, is well-known to speed
up quick demos or samples but doesn't scale to real web sites.</p>

<h4>Does the choice of language really improve productivity and reduce maintenance?</h4>

<p>Robert L. Glass, Tom Demacro and other industry leaders say that choice of
language doesn't have a significant impact on the product.  Fred Brooks'
"No Silver Bullet" essay suggests choice of a language has less than 5%
impact on a project.</p>

<p>Most programming languages focus on the initial implementation phase
of a project, which is a small percentage of a developer's time.  Sparforte
(and Ada, the language Sparforte is modelled on) includes features
that improve other stages of software building and facilitate team communication.
Ada has been shown in large studies to have productivity improvements as much as
double other programming languages.  Expect Sparforte to address more of these
kind of time-consuming issues that other languages neglect.</p>

<h4>How fast are Sparforte scripts?</h4>

<p>Sparforte programs will likely run slower than other languages you are
used to.  There are several reasons for this.</p>

<p>First, Sparforte focused on developing core features,
not on optimizing performance.  Some features are not optimized for speed.</p>

<p>Second, Sparforte is built with the maximum error checking possible.
This included checks done by GCC Ada (which does more compile time and run
time checking compared to most languages), as well as Sparforte's own
extensive error checking.</p>

<p>Third, it is has more powerful features than other languages, and these
features may require more setup to use.  As a general rule, the simpler
the language, the faster the interpreter will run.  Sparforte is more
high level than many languages.</p>

<p>However, Sparforte typically runs over 10,000 to 40,000 commands per second,
depending on your hardware and the nature of the commands.</p>

<p>When evaluating performance, consider the trade-offs for loss of
execution speed compared to Sparforte's other benefits.</p>

<p>Expect performance improvements as the language continues to evolve.</p>

<h4>What do you see as the biggest barriers to adopting Sparforte?</h4>

<p>Sparforte is designed to save time and money: most businesses don't
know how to evaluate the risk of trying Sparforte with the money and
time they will save.  Most programmers are concerned about immediate
gratification, performance and what language will help them get their
next job: Sparforte does not deliver these things.  Most architects
are afraid of trying something new because it could damage their
reputation: as the expression goes, no one got fired for recommending
the status quo.</p>
