<h2><a name="2.2"></a>Script Tutorial 3: Data Types</h2>

<p>If you used other scripting languages, you may find SparForte's
type system confusing.  In most languages, a type is a primitive
representation of data, like an integer or float.  Any new types
must be built up from object classes.</p>

<p>The type system is used for much more than describing the physical
representation of data.  It can be used to construct abstractions that
represent values from the real world and describe how they relate to
each other.  In this way, you work at a "higher level", working with
concepts and not thinking as much about the physical characteristics
of a date type.  Using the type system correctly is important for
effectively writing quality software.</p>

<h3>Every Value Must Have a Type</h3>

<p>As you saw in the earlier tutorials, every value has a data type.  Every
variable or subprogram parameter must be declared with its type.  This means
that SparForte is a language with <b>static typing</b> (although it has some
dynamic typing features which will be described below).  At the
command prompt, you can assign values to new variable names and SparForte will
automatically declare variables and give them the same data type as
the expression.  The type can be changed with the typeset command, or
even deleted with the unset command.  These features only work on the command
prompt.</p>

<p>In a script, you will have to declare all variables yourself and give
them appropriate data types.  You can't change the type of a variable
nor can you destroy a variable.  When a script runs, SparForte performs
type checking before any commands execute, catching type errors early.</p>

<p>SparForte is also a <b>strongly-type</b> language, which means that there are
restrictions for how different types of data can be mixed.  Most strong typing
languages will not allow strings to be mixed with numbers in an expression
(they are treated as incompatible).  However, SparForte uses more strong
checking than this, and even structurally equivalent data values may be
designated as incompatible in some circumstances.</p>

<h3>Creating New Types</h3>

<p>New data types can be created using two different statements.  The
<b>type</b> statement creates a new type derived from an existing type.
The <b>subtype</b> statement creates a renaming of an existing type.
Using type and subtype, you can create a hierarchy or tree of types
without using object classes.</p>

<p>With a new type (created with the type statement), the new type and
the parent type are structurally equivalent.  You can create any number
of new types derived from the parent type but each new type is incompatible
with its sibling or its parent types.  Although they are all structurally
the same, the are logically incompatible.</p>

<p>For example, you can create two new float-based types to represent
weight and distance.</p>

        <center>
        <div class="code">
                <p class="code"><b>type</b> distance_km <b>is</b> <b>new</b> float;<br>
<b>type</b> weight_kg <b>is</b> <b>new</b> float;<br>
        </div>
        </center>

<p>Both distance_km and weight_kg are both types of floats and have the
same properties as floats.  Any function parameter that expects a float
will also accept these new types.  But they are incompatible with each
other: a distance_km value cannot be assigned to a weight_kg, and a
weight_kg function parameter will not accept a distance_km value.  Nor
can you use either of these new types with float function parameter.</p>

<p>They can be used in situations such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>database id numbers</li>
<li>different units of measurement</li>
<li>different characteristics</li>
<li>valid and unchecked web application data</li>
<li>encoded and plain data</li>
</ul>

<p>The type system is static, which means the types are usually checked
before the script is run.  If there are type incompatibilities, they will
be discovered before anything executes.</p>

<h3>Creating Subtypes</h3>

<p>The <b>subtype</b> statement works much the same way as the type statement
except that a subtype acts like a renaming of the existing type.  The
new type and the parent type are structurally equivalent.  You can
create any number of new types derived from the parent type and each
new type is compatible with its sibling type.  They can all be used
interchangeably.</p>

<p>For example, you can create a shorthand name for a type with a long
name for an integer-based type like this.</p>

        <center>
        <div class="code">
                <p class="code"><b>type</b> customer_id <b>is</b> <b>new</b> integer;<br>
<b>subtype</b> cid <b>is</b> customer_id;<br>
        </div>
        </center>

<p>cid is an integer type that is a renaming of customer_id and can be
used any place that customer_id is used.  A customer_id value can be
assigned cid variable, or the other way around.</p>

<h3>Type Casting</h3>

<p>Any two structurally equivalent types can be explicitly treated the
same by using a type name as a function.  This is called <b>type casting</b>.
Use type casting to override type incompatibilities.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you have two types, one for HTML encoded strings
and one for plain HTML strings.</p>

        <center>
        <div class="code">
                <p class="code"><b>type</b> html_encoded_string <b>is</b> <b>new</b> string;<br>
<b>type</b> html_plain_string <b>is</b> <b>new</b> string;<br>
...<br>
title : constant html_plain_string := "My Page Title";<br>
web_page : html_encoded_string;<br>
        </div>
        </center>

<p>If you know that the title variable contains data that doesn't need
to be HTML encoded, you can add it to the web_page by converting
it to an html_encoded_string value using type casting.</p>

        <center>
        <div class="code">
                <p class="code">web_page := web_page &amp; html_encoded_string( title );<br>
        </div>
        </center>

<p>In SparForte, the positive and natural types are treated specially.
These are subsets of the integer type.  Positive values are always
compatible with natural values, and natural values are always
compatible with integer values.  But natural values cannot be assigned
to a positive, for example, because the range of possible values for a
natural is larger than that of the positive type.</p>

<h3>When to Use Types and Subtypes</h3>

<p>There are different opinions for how to use the type system.</p>

<p>Some developers believe that the primitive, predefined types
should only be used to create new types and, in your program, your
variables and parameters should only use types that you have
created.</p>

<p>Some developers are concerned that too many types can be
cumbersome, requiring extra type casting, converting one type to
another.  For example, if you have a lot of different integer
types and you want to use them in an expression, you may have to
typecast them all to integer and then typecast the result back
to the final type, which makes the expression hard to read.</p>

<p>It is important that you use new types where they make the
most sense.  If a customer id and a supplier id will never be
combined in an expression, then it makes good sense to define them
as incompatible types.</p>

<h3>Predefined Types</h3>

<p>There are many predefined types.  More types are declared in
the built-in packages.  These are described in detail in the
Reference section on <a href="ref_types.html">types</a>.  The following
type tree shows most of the predefined types and how they are
related to one another.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/sparforte_type_tree.gif" alt="[SparForte Type Tree]"></p>

<h3>Universal Types</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the other tutorials, SparForte also has universal
types.  These are the most primitive types and are the base types of
most of the other predefined types.  A universal type is special in
that it is automatically compatible with any type of the same
structure.  These are intended for short, simple scripts or working
on the command line when you don't want to take advantage of
SparForte's typing system.</p>

<p>There are three universal types.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>universal_typeless</b> is the root type of string and numeric types.
It will be treated as a string or number depending on context.  If
the context is ambiguous, it will be treated as a string.</li>
<li><b>universal_string</b> is the root type of all strings and characters.
It automatically matches any string or character type.</li>
<li><b>universal_numeric</b> is the root type of all number types.  It
automatically matches any integer, float or other number type.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because these types are root types, if you create a new type
using type or subtype, the new type will not have the special
properties of the universal type.  This shouldn't be much of an
obstacle, since you use the universal types to avoid the type
system.</p>

<p>These types are similar to <b>weak typing</b>: an universal_typeless
variable is always contains a universal_typeless value, but the value
is interpreted as a string or integer depending on the expression or
context, implicitly type casting the value.  This is different from
<b>dynamic typing</b>, where the type of a variable is unknown until the
program runs.</p>

<p>There is a trade-off when using universal types.  They can be
more convenient when creating a quick prototype or a short script,
but you also lose the safety, readability and easy scaling advantages
of explicit types and compile-time error checking.  Like any data type,
be cautious and chose the appropriate type for your task.</p>

<h3>Types, Subtypes and Aggregate Types</h3>

<p>Another use for the type system is to construct aggregate types
such as arrays or records.</p>

<p>Once you define a new aggregate type, you can create derived types
using the type and subtype statements just like any other type.</p>
