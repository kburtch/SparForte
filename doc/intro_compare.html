<h3><a name="compare"></a>Comparing SparForte</h3>

<img class="padded_left" src="pictures/hawaiian_punch_punchy.png" width="128" height="141" alt="[Hawaiian Punch - Punchy]" \>

<p>There are many open source scripting languages and shells
available.&nbsp;
They are often created to solve particular kinds of problems.&nbsp; The
following sections summarize the major differences between SparForte and
these
other common tools.</p>
<h3><a name="bash"></a>SparForte vs. BASH</h3>
<p>BASH (the "Bourne Again SHell") is an extended version of the
traditional
UNIX Bourne shell (sh).&nbsp;&nbsp; BASH supports most of the Bourne
shell's
original syntax, but also has features of the C and Korn shells such as
integer and array variables.&nbsp; The Bourne shell syntax is hard to
debug
and is not compatible with other computer languages.&nbsp; BASH can act
as an interactive shell or can run scripts.</p>
<p>SparForte is a shell that&nbsp; has the fundamental syntax of the Bourne
shell.&nbsp; However, SparForte uses a different language for advanced
features
making SparForte easier to read and debug.&nbsp; SparForte scripts can be
compiled
into Java or .NET byte code or into an executable program.&nbsp; SparForte's
reliability, scalability and speed make it ideally suited for
professional
scripting projects.&nbsp; SparForte can act as an interactive shell and can
run scripts.
</p>
<h3><a name="python"></a>SparForte vs. Python</h3>
<p>Python (named after "Monty Python") is an interpreted language designed
for small projects needing rapid development. It is not a shell.
Because of it's weak encapsulation features and lack of strong
typing,Python
scripts are limited in scalability and extensibility. The shortcuts
provided by Python cause reliability problems in large, complex
projects.
Because of its proprietary design, projects developed in Python cannot
easily
be upgraded to a compiled language.</p>
<p>SparForte is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. SparForte scripts are slower to develop than
Python
programs but are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project. The
shortcuts SparForte provides are carefully chosen so as not to undercut
reliability.
SparForte scripts can be easily upgraded to a compiled language.
</p>
<h3><a name="perl"></a>SparForte vs. Perl</h3>
<p>Perl ("Practical Extraction and Report Language") is, as its name
suggests,
a scripting language for data analysis and designing reports. PERL is
good
for writing short scripts to process text information such as system
logs.</p>
<p>Perl is well known for being hard to learn and read. It combines the
features of completely unrelated tools (including shell scripts, the
sed
command, and the awk command). In fact, this was the reason Larry Wall
developed Perl in the first place. Perl scripts must be extensively
commented
to be readable. SparForte, on the other hand, is based on an international
standard and has features that are designed to fit together smoothly.
SparForte
scripts are very readable, even with limited comments.
</p>
<p>Perl developers also endorse Perl's shortcuts as making scripts more
reliable (by making them a smaller) and as aid for programmers. SparForte
also
contains shortcuts, but it makes no claim that smaller scripts are
easier to
maintain. While Perl shortcuts can actually hurt development, SparForte's
shortcuts
are carefully chosen so that a programmer can't "shoot himself in the
foot".
Some kinds of shortcuts are dangerous. Perl will convert a number to a
string
automatically, whether or not the programmer made a mistake. If SparForte
sees a
number where a string was expected, it reports it as a serious
contradiction.
</p>
<p>Perl is not a shell and is not designed to run programs or to handle
process control. However, it contains many features beyond report
generation,
including interprocess communication and database access. Because of
its
pattern matching features, cryptic syntax and shell-like quoting rules,
Perl
makes large projects error-prone and difficult to maintain.
</p>
<p>Perl is often described as portable. With GNU tools and the Linux
operating
system, portable languages like PERL are no longer necessary. Even when
PERL
is chosen for portability, it is not based on any standard: features
can
change and break between even minor releases of PERL making PERL
scripts
difficult to port and upgrade. SparForte is heavily tested and based on an
international standard making it more portable than PERL.
</p>
<p>SparForte is a Linux shell and shell language designed for high
reliability
business and scientific applications. Although it's not a report
generation
language, it can generate reports using formatted output and pattern
matching
like PERL does.
</p>
<p>SparForte scripts are not as "quick-and-dirty" as PERL but
but SparForte scripts are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project.
Because of its emphasis on a typo-resistant syntax, SparForte is easier to
maintain, especially when used large projects. SparForte scripts can also be
compiled into executable programs, Java applets or .Net programs.
</p>
<h3><a name="plsql"></a>SparForte vs. PL/SQL</h3>
<p>PL/SQL is the Oracle stored procedure language.&nbsp; Both SparForte and
PL/SQL
are based on Ada making SparForte very easy to learn for PL/SQL users.&nbsp;
Many PL/SQL commands and statements will work in SparForte.&nbsp; SparForte
supports
the PostgreSQL database and you can execute queries and examine
results.</p>
<h3><a name="psql"></a>SparForte vs. PostgreSQL psql</h3>
<p>psql is the text-based database client for PostgreSQL. You can display
information about databases, run queries and get formatted responses.
It
is not a shell and cannot run shell commands.</p>
<p>SparForte is a shell and scripting language. In addition, it can display
information about PostgreSQL databases, run queries and display the
results
as psql-style responses all at the SparForte command prompt. The user
doesn't
have to switch between a shell and psql--SparForte handles most database
needs
by itself.
</p>
<h3><a name="ada95"></a>SparForte vs. Ada 95</h3>
<p>Ada 95 (named after the world's first programmer) is a multithreaded,
exception
handling, object-oriented programming language used for large,
high-integrity
projects. It is known for abundant features, high performance, strong
checking
and readability.</p>
<p>The SparForte shell is not an Ada interpreter. SparForte uses AdaScript, a
subset
of the Ada 95 language with additional features specifically for
interactive
shell sessions. Because of its Ada 95 background, SparForte scripts are easy
to create, maintain, debug and can be compiled into fast, executable
programs
using an Ada 95 compiler.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for full Ada compilers or interpreters, they are
available on the Internet.
</p>
<h3><a name="java"></a>SparForte vs. Java</h3>
<p>Java is an interpreted programming language with threads, exception
handling
and object-oriented features. It can be compiled into "byte code" and
applets
can be created for web pages.&nbsp; Java is known for it's awkward
syntax,
poor performance and debugging problems because of its C
heritage.&nbsp;
Java is not a shell.</p>
<p>SparForte scripts can also be compiled into Java or .NET byte code (using
the JGNAT compiler) and run the same way as Java applets/applications,
including web page applets.&nbsp; SparForte scripts are easy to create,
maintain,
debug and can be compiled into fast, executable programs using GCC.
</p>
<h3><a name="php"></a>SparForte vs. PHP</h3>
<p>PHP is an HTML preprocessor and scripting language. In many ways, PHP
resembles Perl but it is not Perl-compatible. PHP is often difficult to
debug. It is not a shell and it does not have a native template engine.</p>
<p>SparForte is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. SparForte scripts are more secure and robust
than PHP and they are easier to debug and maintain over the lifetime of
a project. SparForte has a native template engine. SparForte scripts can be
easily
upgraded to fast, compiled applications (using GCC) or applets (with
JGNAT).
</p>
<h3><a name="ruby"></a>SparForte vs. Ruby</h3>
<p>Ruby is a scripting language with threads, exception handling and
objects.&nbsp;
Ruby is completely object oriented.&nbsp; Ruby has a very compressed
syntax
that uses the "Principle of Least Surprise"--that is, Ruby attempts to
"second guess" the programmer.&nbsp; In some cases, removing a single
space,
or capitalizing a single letter, can cause a Ruby script to radically
change
its behavior.&nbsp; Ruby is not a shell.</p>
<p>SparForte is a shell and language designed for high reliability business
and scientific applications. SparForte scripts are slower to develop than
Ruby
programs but are easier to maintain over the lifetime of a project.
Changing
capitalization and white space does not change the how a script is run.
SparForte features do not fall victim to the "feature bloat" syndrome that
weakens
the reliability of a language. SparForte scripts can be easily upgraded to a
compiled application or applet.
</p>
<h3><a name="ruby"></a>SparForte vs. Lua</h3>
<p>Lua's web site describes it as a "powerful, fast and light-weight".
These are hype terms and contradictory: something cannot be
powerful and light at the same time, the way gold is not free and
a Ford Focus is not a luxury car.  Lua is an open-source language
designed for game scripting.  It is popular with Portugese developers.</p>
<p>Although Lua scripts look similar to the SparForte,
Lua is not designed on software engineering principles.  It cannot
be effectively used in enterprise programming.
</p>
<h3><a name="qbasic"></a>SparForte vs.  QBASIC/QuickBASIC</h3>
<p>QBASIC or QuickBASIC is a text-screen or console version of the BASIC
language
with a built-in IDE.&nbsp; It features interactive debugging and
drop-down
menus.&nbsp; SparForte, when combined with PegaSoft's TIA IDE, provides a
text-screen
language with drop-down menus and interactive debugging.</p>
<h3><a name="lua"></a>SparForte vs.  Lua</h3>
<p>Lua is a programming language popular for writing add-on scripts or
game macros.  It has good speed, is easy to call from other languages.
The basic syntax looks somewhat like SparForte but it is silent on many
error conditions is is not designed to handle large projects.</p>
