--- Expression Side-effects
--
-- Side-effects refer to any changes in more-global variables that can cause
-- unpredictability when evaluation an expression.  These include.
--
-- 1. Writing to a variable then using it in any active expression.
-- 2. Reading a variable in an active expression then trying to write to it
--    (not actually a side-effect, but could become one if the expression is
--    changed so it executes in a different order).
-- 3. Two "threads" (meaning functions and/or contracts) trying to write to
--    the same global, creating a data race condition.  While ideally no two
--    "threads" should write to a global, this eliminates too much useful
--    functionality, so we instead assume that one "thread" is smart enough
--    to manage multiple writes by itself.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--- Expression Factor Stack
--
-- This is used by checkExpressionFactorVolatilityOnWrite
--
-- Oddly enough, testing for writing then reading is much easier than reading
-- then writing.  With reading then writing, expressions come and go so we
-- need their identifiers in a stack.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

type activeExpressionId is record
     id     : identifier;   -- which identifier?
     exprId : line_count;   -- seen in what expression?
end record;

procedure pushExpressionId( id : identifier );
-- Push an identifier which is used in an expression factor to the active
-- expression identifiers stack, associating it with the current expression.
-- (The current expression is found in the global lastExpressionInstruction.)

procedure pullExpressionIds;
-- Discard all identifiers associated with the current expression.  This is
-- done when an expression is finished.
-- (The current expression is found in the global lastExpressionInstruction.)

function isActiveExpressionId( id : identifier ) return boolean;
-- True if id is in use in an active expression.  That is, that it is found in
-- the active expression identifiers stack.

procedure clearActiveExpressionIds;
-- Erase the active expression identifiers stack.


-- Side-effect tests
--
-- These procedures test for a side-effect issues and report an error if one is
-- detected.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


procedure checkExpressionFactorVolatility( id: identifier );
-- Check to see if a factor in an expression is read after it was written
-- to after the expression was started.
-- Example: In x := f1() + y, if y was written to by f1(), report an error.
-- This is Case #1.

procedure checkExpressionFactorVolatilityOnWrite( id: identifier );
-- Check to see if an identifier is written after it was read
-- by an expression, while the expression is incomplete.
-- Example: In x := y + f1(), if f1 changes y.
-- This is Case #2.

procedure checkDoubleDataFlowWrite( id : identifier );
-- Check to see if, at run-time, two different data flows write to the same
-- unprotected variable.  Also updates writtenByFlow.
-- This is Case #3.

--procedure checkDoubleGlobalWrite( id : identifier );
-- A strict check for anything being written twice after an expression
-- is started.
